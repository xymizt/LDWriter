Convert CSV files to LD files for Motec's I2Pro.

Credits to https://github.com/gotzl/ldparser for reverse engineering the code for LD files

requirements:

numpy
pandas


CSV format:

Time, 	Channel1, 	Channel2
s, 	unit1, 		unit2
0.5, 	1, 		1,

Folders:

LDParser
- ldparser.py: source code, feel free to modify it to suit your application and to understand the structure of the .ld file
- ldparser.exe: compiled shell executable with arguments (use pyinstaller to compile as exe file)

	Arguments:

            -p "C:\single\file\path.csv"
            -f frequencyInteger
            -c comment
            -e event
            -s session
            -d driver
            -i vehicleID
            -v venue
            --folder "C:\single\folder" # target folder where to save LD files
            --help  # help

Possible problems:

- The ld file may fail to load in your version of I2Pro:
- To see how your I2Pro generates LD files, export a test LD file, then compare the bytes that are generated by the ldparser.py with the actual files (such as serial code, ld number, file)

LD file structure:

the file is a binary file that uses numbers as pointers to various data

HEAD 1890 bytes various general information

EVENT 1154 bytes specific information about the logged data (I don't use it but bytes must be allocated in order for the ld file to be loaded correctly)

META_DATA 124*n_channels bytes information of all the various channels with pointers to data and units
